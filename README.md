# JDA_Final_Project
Data Analysis with the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2019 data and creating a dashboard.

Collecting the top programming skills that are most in demand from various sources including:

1. Job postings

2. Training portals

3. Surveys

Once done collecting enough data, begin analyzing the data and identify insights and trends that may include the following:

- What are the top programming languages in demand?

- What are the top database skills in demand?

- What are the popular IDEs?

Then we begin by scraping internet web sites and accessing APIs to collect data in various formats like .csv files, excel sheets, and databases.   
 
Once this is completed,  make that data ready for analysis using data wrangling techniques. 
 
When the data is ready we will then want to apply statistical techniques to analyze the data.  Then bring all of our information together by using  IBM Cognos Analytics to create dashboard. And finally, show off storytelling skills by sharing findings in a presentation.
